        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
        Hello! My name is <strong>Yuntae Ju</strong>, and I am a researcher working at the intersection of
        <strong>statistical machine learning, longitudinal data analysis, and human performance modeling</strong>.
        My research focuses on developing <strong>data-driven and interpretable modeling frameworks</strong>
        to study complex behavioral and physiological processes in
        <strong>longitudinal and observational settings</strong>, with applications to elite sports and
        population-level health.
        </p>

        <p>
        I specialize in <strong>machine learning–based prediction and risk modeling</strong>,
        mixed-effects and hierarchical modeling, and time-series analysis.
        A central emphasis of my work is on <strong>handling repeated measures, uncertainty, and rigorous model validation</strong>,
        including grouped cross-validation and resampling-based inference.
        I am particularly interested in integrating flexible ML methods with
        statistically principled approaches to ensure robustness, interpretability,
        and transparency in high-stakes evaluation contexts.
        </p>

        <p>
        Much of my applied research has involved large-scale athlete monitoring data,
        where I analyze performance trajectories and atypical deviations using
        ML-based predictive models alongside longitudinal statistical frameworks.
        While my background includes elite sport analytics, my broader interests lie in
        <strong>population health monitoring, health policy, and fairness-aware statistical modeling</strong>.
        My long-term goal is to develop methodological frameworks that support
        evidence-based decision-making while carefully distinguishing
        <strong>prediction from causal inference</strong>.
        </p>

                <div class="pub-abstract">
                    This study examined elite men’s 100m freestyle performance using an integrated framework combining
                    artificial intelligence (AI), explainable AI (XAI), and longitudinal mixed-effects modeling.
                    Competition records were analyzed with ensemble-based machine learning models trained using athlete-level
                    grouped cross-validation and bootstrap resampling, achieving strong predictive accuracy.
                    SHAP-based interpretation identified athlete age as the most influential predictor, followed by national
                    economic context, while longitudinal mixed-effects modeling revealed a U-shaped age–performance trajectory
                    with peak performance at 23.7 years.
                    Collectively, the framework demonstrates how prediction, interpretability, and longitudinal modeling can be
                    jointly leveraged for robust and transparent performance evaluation in elite sport.

                    This study evaluates the latent potential of rookie pitchers in the Korea Baseball Organization
                    (KBO) by identifying pitcher archetypes using K-means clustering and examining their association
                    with early-career performance (WAR). Using debut-season physical and performance indicators,
                    we show that high-velocity pitcher types contribute most substantially to team success.
                    A positive correlation between fastball velocity and WAR further suggests that pitching velocity
                    is a key signal for draft evaluation, highlighting the value of machine learning–based analysis
                    for talent identification in professional baseball.
