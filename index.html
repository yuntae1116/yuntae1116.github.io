        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            Hello, my name is <strong>Yuntae Ju</strong>. I am an applied statistician and data scientist
            working on <strong>interpretable statistical learning methods for longitudinal and observational data
            with hierarchical structure</strong>. My research focuses on developing
            <strong>robust, transparent, and well-validated predictive modeling frameworks</strong>
            for repeated-measures data in high-stakes evaluation settings, with applications to
            human performance and population health.
        </p>

        <p>
            I specialize in <strong>machine learning–based prediction and risk modeling</strong>,
            mixed-effects and hierarchical modeling, and time-series analysis.
            A central emphasis of my work is on <strong>handling repeated measures, individual heterogeneity,
            and uncertainty</strong>, supported by rigorous validation strategies such as
            <strong>grouped cross-validation and resampling-based inference</strong>.
            I am particularly interested in integrating flexible machine learning methods with
            statistically principled approaches to ensure interpretability, robustness,
            and reliability in real-world data.
        </p>

        <p>
            Much of my applied research has used large-scale athlete monitoring data as a
            <strong>testbed for methodological development</strong>, where I study performance trajectories
            and atypical deviations using integrated ML and longitudinal statistical frameworks.
            While my background includes elite sport analytics, my broader research interests extend to
            <strong>population health monitoring, fairness-aware modeling, and decision-support systems</strong>.
            My long-term goal is to develop methodological frameworks that enable evidence-based
            decision-making while carefully distinguishing
            <strong>predictive modeling from causal inference</strong>.

                <div class="pub-abstract">
                    This study examined elite men’s 100m freestyle performance using an integrated framework combining
                    artificial intelligence (AI), explainable AI (XAI), and longitudinal mixed-effects modeling.
                    Competition records were analyzed with ensemble-based machine learning models trained using athlete-level
                    grouped cross-validation and bootstrap resampling, achieving strong predictive accuracy.
                    SHAP-based interpretation identified athlete age as the most influential predictor, followed by national
                    economic context, while longitudinal mixed-effects modeling revealed a U-shaped age–performance trajectory
                    with peak performance at 23.7 years.
                    Collectively, the framework demonstrates how prediction, interpretability, and longitudinal modeling can be
                    jointly leveraged for robust and transparent evaluation of longitudinal observational data.

                    This study evaluates the latent potential of rookie pitchers in the Korea Baseball Organization
                    (KBO) by identifying pitcher archetypes using K-means clustering and examining their association
                    with early-career performance. Using debut-season physical and performance indicators,
                    we show that high-velocity pitcher types contribute most substantially to team success.
                    A positive correlation between fastball velocity and WAR further suggests that pitching velocity
                    is a key signal for draft evaluation, highlighting the value of machine learning–based analysis
                    for talent identification in professional baseball.
